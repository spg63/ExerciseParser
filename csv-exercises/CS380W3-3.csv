Timestamp,ID,Your first and last name(s),"Problem: Tracing search algorithm for the Romanian Railroad problem. 

Find the shortest path from Arad to Bucharest, using Algorithm A*. Estimates of the distance from each city to Bucharest are made using the geometric (straight-line) between the cities, given in the table at the bottom. You are to find a shortest path from A (Arad) to B (Bucharest) with Algorithm A*. 

Show the OPEN list at each cycle of the algorithm; referring to each city by the first letter of its name. (A concise way of showing your answer would be to show the name of each node as it is added to OPEN followed by its depth, heuristic, and total=depth+h.)
",Compare your answer with the previous exercise where you used UCS.
